We reach over 1,200,000 visitors monthly and continue to grow month after month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re looking to strengthen our writing team with a few people that are interested in writing about software (with a focus on backup, storage, project management and VPNs). If that sounds like a good fit for you, keep reading to see what we offer and what we expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who We Are<\/strong><br>At Cloudwards, we create content that people love and search engines understand. We do that by providing expert and honest reviews for the best cloud-based software and tools available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We publish several articles every day, Monday through Friday. Our massive content library includes thousands of articles, and we continue to publish more every day. We\u2019re passionate about what we do and we have ambitious plans for our future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s where you come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we\u2019re looking for are writers with native or fluent English, and who are comfortable with American use and style. You need to care about our readers and be willing to put in that extra bit of effort to properly inform them of the software purchases they\u2019re considering. You need to really be into how software works and translating that into solid copy that really gets into the nitty-gritty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what\u2019s in it for you, and why would you want to join us?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7 Reasons to Join Cloudwards as a Freelance Writer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Write Honest Reviews<\/strong><br>Our content library has thousands of detailed reviews, comparisons, roundups, etc. We value honesty and transparency, and we never sacrifice quality for quantity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most review sites, we make a small commission off of any sales we help facilitate, but we take our role as reviewers seriously. We only give fair assessments of the products we review &#8212; we aren\u2019t going to say a terrible service is good just to make a few dollars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t just out of the goodness of our hearts, either: we figure that by being honest, we&#8217;ll easily become the trusted go-to site for our audience. Trustworthiness is its own reward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s something you can get behind, we\u2019d love to have you on the team!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Consistent Work &amp; Prompt Pay<\/strong><br>We know that working as a freelance writer has its challenges, including having a consistent workflow. That\u2019s why we can guarantee you a certain number of articles per month, with a minimum of four articles per month. However, if you want to write more, we love that! You can write as much as you want. You\u2019ll also be able to see the upcoming articles in advance so you can plan your schedule accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for payments, we pay all our team members promptly by the first of each month for articles that have been published. This means a consistent and reliable paycheck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All pieces will go through our full editorial queue &#8212; feedback from your editor, copy edits, fact checking, final edits, formatting &#8212; meaning it takes roughly a week from first submission for it to appear on the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us and you won\u2019t have to worry about inconsistent work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Strong Editorial Guidance &amp; Training<\/strong><br>We know that you\u2019ll write more and better if you have a support structure around you. That\u2019s why we create a thorough briefing for each article we assign you, with clear instructions on what angle you\u2019ll write, how many words to include, plus which headings and topics to cover. There\u2019s no second guessing what the editorial team wants from you &#8212; it\u2019s clear before you put any words on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you\u2019re willing to work with a nice outline structure, you\u2019ll be able to work efficiently and not have to worry about major revisions after you\u2019ve put a lot of work into the article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you\u2019ll also have one dedicated editor, so they will be able to provide consistent feedback to help you grow as a writer with Cloudwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work with us, and you\u2019ll feel supported from day one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Clear, Creative Writing<\/strong><br>Here at Cloudwards, we try to have a friendly, more casual tone so readers aren\u2019t intimidated by the content. Do you hate the words \u201cplethora\u201d and \u201cmyriad\u201d? We do, too. We use simple language that anyone can understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we want our writers to have fun with the content and let their personal voice come through &#8212; no faceless writers for us. (Oh yeah, and you get your by line, and your bio and headshot on our site\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudwards.net\/about\/\">about<\/a>\u201d page.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If writing clear, creative content is something you\u2019re good at, then this position is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Work Remotely and Set Your Own Schedule<\/strong><br>We are a fully remote team with workers all over the world, from California and Mexico to Kenya and Cyprus. As long as you are a fluent English writer and you have a consistent WiFi connection, where you live is up to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, great people don\u2019t necessarily do their best work by staring at a monitor for 8 hours straight every day. So at Cloudwards, you\u2019ll have the flexibility to design a schedule that allows you to do your best work from anywhere in the world. You\u2019ll have only one deadline &#8212; the day that your article\/s are due each week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, as long as you can check your messages for feedback from your dedicated editor and make timely adjustments to your articles as they move through the editorial queue, your schedule is fully flexible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If that works for you, join us!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Get Training, Plus Growth and Promotion Opportunities<\/strong><br>We\u2019re a fast-growing company, which means lots of growth opportunities for our high performers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are consistently writing strong content that follows our standards, we can increase your article numbers each week (if you want). Plus, if you prove to be passionate about the content and the team &#8212; and if you have the interest in growing professionally &#8212; you could be considered for joining our editorial team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prove to be a reliable freelancer for us, you could become eligible for training courses for growth opportunities, from writing courses to copy editing tips to SEO training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer just to keep excelling at your current freelance writing role, that\u2019s fine too. The point is, the opportunities will be there if you want them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Join a Fun Team<\/strong><br>We\u2019re a fun bunch, with team members in 43 cities around the world! We enjoy spending time together; right now, that happens digitally, but team members enjoy the occasional meetup when we are in the same geological area. We even had our first-ever company-wide meetup in Cyprus in November 2022. We have a great thing going, and we\u2019d love for you to be a part of it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s What We Expect From You<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have strong writing experience about cloud-based technologies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are a good communicator with our editorial team.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can get online regularly to check and respond to any new messages or updates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can commit to at least one article per week (four per month), with a word count usually running between 1,500 and 3,000.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can work with our project management tool (ClickUp), communication tool (Zulip), Google Docs and SEO browser add-on tools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can take feedback from the editorial team and have a positive attitude.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You hold journalism ethics to high standards &#8212; we have a zero-tolerance plagiarism policy, zero subcontractor policy, and zero AI-writing policy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The starting rate per word is 6 cents (USD), but this can be increased based on experience.&nbsp;If this sounds like the team for you,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/app.workello.com\/a\/cloudwards-cloudwards-content-writer\">please apply here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>*Please make sure to attach either your CV or LinkedIn profile on the application form.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Application Process<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Initial application review &#8212; we will begin reviewing applications on a rolling basis starting October 16.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unpaid writing trial (500 words)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>30-minute video interview<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paid writing trial (~1,500 words)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Location Anywhere Work can be done remotely Job Type Freelance Category Blog \/ Article Writing Company Type Studio DESCRIPTION Are You a Writer With an&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_themeisle_gutenberg_block_has_review":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=476"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":477,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/476\/revisions\/477"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=476"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=476"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/news\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=476"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
